@Payal Task Update:


(1) Crowd Funding :(8:30 hours)

I have an understanding of framework development from scratch.
As required, I have installed the prerequisite software as well as plugins and configurations.
 - Java Development Kit (JDK) 
 - Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
 - Maven (usually integrated with Eclipse)
I have created a new Maven project in Eclipse.
Add the necessary dependencies for Selenium and other libraries as needed, and update the pom.xml file.
As per the new created Maven project, I have an understanding of the relevant file structure.
Detailed explanation of each component for src/main/java and src/test/java, including their purpose and exact usage.
I have worked on designing an automation framework from scratch using the Page Object Model (POM) method.
I have implemented test script execution for opening and closing the web browser.
I had a discussion with Ahesan Ali regarding framework development.
Additionally, I have set up browser launching along with TestNG test methods for script execution.

(2) I have attended a demo session with the team.

- I have completed the framework development from scratch and successfully launched the browser.
- Once the homepage opened, I verified the dynamic details to ensure they matched the expected results for the Title, Email ID, and Mobile Number.
- After confirming that the homepage loaded correctly, I scrolled down and up, then verified the footer title text for 'Our Newsletter.'
- I clicked on the sign-in button to ensure the user was redirected properly by verifying the title text and details on the sign-up page.
- I have created test scripts for negative scenarios on the Sign-Up page, which are expected to verify these scenarios using assertions.
- The scriptâ€™s executed for output and the console output were used to verify the dynamic details.
- I have set the executed priority for each method to ensure the scripts run in the correct sequence.
